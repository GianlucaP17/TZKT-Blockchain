    ///getPosts() method doesn’t contain actual business logic, just calling another method for the sake of simplicity. But this is where you apply your business logic. For example you can check if a post contains racist words to ban the post — or feature it if you are racist. Or you can check if you have added any of these posts to your favorites and apply a star to it.
